# 2016 NYPD Stop Question and Frisk Data exploration

### Data Wrangling and Analysis in Python, using Jupyter

This repository explores the process of wrangling/analyzing/converting data into a webmap ready form.  All data processing was completed using Python, and a variety of packages including Geopandas, within an interactive Jupyter Notebook environment.  

The following packages must be installed ($ conda install) into the active Conda environment:

Jupyter (allows use of jupyter notebook Python 3 interactive environment)
Geopandas (integrates other packages geospatial components)
Matplotlib (dataviz package - allows plotting of visualizations)

If the notebook will not run within Github, here is an [HTML version](#).

### Basic webmapping, using Leaflet

Completing the pipeline, data analyzed and converted in the notebook above was pulled into a webmap.  

Be sure to explore this data in a simple, interactive [webmap](https://github.com/rakatk0/2016-StopQuestionFrisk/map/).
